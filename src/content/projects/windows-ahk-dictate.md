Press a button, speak, get text. Completely local, completely private.

## What It Does

Windows AHK Dictate lets you bind any button on your keyboard or mouse to trigger local voice transcription powered by Whisper. No cloud APIs, no subscriptions, no data leaving your machine.

## Features

- **Any Button Binding** - Works with Logitech G HUB, Razer Synapse, or any software that can send keystrokes
- **G502 LED Feedback** - If you're using a Logitech G502 mouse, the LEDs pulse to show recording state
- **RDP Compatible** - Works over Remote Desktop sessions, so you can transcribe on your home server from anywhere
- **Completely Private** - Whisper runs locally. Your voice never leaves your machine.
