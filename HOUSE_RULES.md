## BETTING VARIATIONS

### 1. KILL HAND - Required kill pot (active for full orbit, group choice)
**Trigger:** Player wins 2 consecutive pots → give kill button, next hand is killed. Kill button neutral if: first hand, winner quit, pot split with neither having button.  
**Kill Post:** Kill player posts 2x BB (50¢) in addition to normal blind/ante. Full kill doubles all limits: 2x blinds (SB 20¢, BB 50¢), 2x max bet ($2), 2x pot limit ($5).  
**Action:** Killer acts in proper turn (after person on immediate right). Kill blinds are part of pot.  
**Qualification:** No pot-size requirement for first "leg". Second "leg" qualifies if player wins at least one full bet (not part of blind structure). If player with "leg up" splits pot, retains "leg up" for next hand. If kill player wins again, must kill again (same amount). Only one kill per deal. New player may play killed pot by agreeing to kill next pot.

### 2. BOMB POT - Alternate mode for Holdem/Short Deck - Group decides
**Structure:** Play for full orbit. Blinds/Antes are doubled. Dealer deals 2 separate boards, best hand each board splits pot 50/50  
**Before:** Everyone antes 2x (e.g., 2x BB = 50¢ each)  
**During:** Dealer deals 2 complete boards (2 flops, 2 turns, 2 rivers), same hole cards for both, bet on both as single entity  
**Showdown:** Best hand Board 1 wins 50%, best hand Board 2 wins 50%, same player can win both
